# [Elasticsearch-JavaAPI-connection](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/installation.html)
This repository shows basic connection between JavaAPI and Elasticsearch server.

## [Implementation](https://github.com/af4092/Elasticsearch-JavaAPI-connection/tree/main/ElasticsearchConnectionCheckHTTP/src/main/java/org/example)
1. Java client `ElasticsearchConnectionCheckHTTP` that establishes a connection to an Elasticsearch cluster and checks if the connection is successful using HTTP.
- Variables:
  - The code declares and initializes several variables:
  - host: Represents the IP address or hostname of the Elasticsearch cluster.
  - port: Represents the port number on which the Elasticsearch cluster is running.
  - username: Represents the username for authentication with the Elasticsearch cluster.
  - password: Represents the password for authentication with the Elasticsearch cluster.
- Building the Elasticsearch Client:
  - The code creates a `RestClientBuilder` object to configure the Elasticsearch client.
  - It uses the `RestClient.builder()` method and specifies the host, port, and "http" scheme to build an HTTP host.
  - The `setHttpClientConfigCallback` method is used to configure the HTTP client with authentication credentials.
  - It creates a `CredentialsProvider` object, sets the AuthScope to ANY, and provides the `UsernamePasswordCredentials`.
  - The httpClientBuilder is then configured with the setDefaultCredentialsProvider method.
  - Finally, the RestHighLevelClient is created using the configured RestClientBuilder.
- Checking the Connection:
  - The code attempts to ping the Elasticsearch cluster using the `client.ping` method and passing `RequestOptions.DEFAULT`
  - If the ping is successful, it prints "Connection is SUCCESSFUL."
  - If an IOException occurs during the ping, it prints "Connection is FAILED" along with the exception message.
- Closing the Client:
  - The `client.close()` method is called in a finally block to ensure the client resources are released.
2. `FileReadabilityCheck` checks the readability of a file.
- Import Statement:
  - The code imports the `java.io.File` class, which represents a file on the file system.
- File Path:
  - The code declares a variable named `filePath` and assigns it a file path string.
- Creating a File Object:
  - The code creates a `File object` using the `filePath` string.
  - The File object represents the file specified by the file path.
- Checking File Readability:
  - The code uses an if statement to check the existence and readability of the file.
  - The `exists()` method checks if the file exists.
  - The `canRead()` method checks if the file is readable.
  - If both conditions are true, it prints "File is readable".
  - If either condition is false, it prints "File is not readable".

## [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/af4092/Elasticsearch-JavaAPI-connection/tree/main)

- [Elasticsearch Java API Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/index.html): The Java API client provides strongly typed requests and responses for all Elasticsearch APIs.  
- [Elasticsearch warning - ignore_throttled parameter is deprecated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72271872/elasticsearch-warning-ignore-throttled-parameter-is-deprecated) - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Elasticsearch warning - ignore_throttled parameter is deprecated issued which has answer
- [Do not send default ignore_throttled parameter since it is deprecated](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/84827) - github discussion board about the particular issue
- [How to connect to elasticsearch server using rest client with IP address](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56951310/how-to-connect-to-elasticsearch-server-using-rest-client-with-ip-address) - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): The cluster coordination algorithm has changed in 7.0 234 and in order to be safe it requires some specific configuration. We relax that requirement (that is, we run in a less-safe mode) when you bind to localhost only, but if/when you change `network.host` we enforce that your configure the cluster safely.
- [Discovery configuration is required in production](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/breaking-changes-7.0.html#breaking_70_discovery_changes) - production deployments of Elasticsearch now require at least one of the following settings to be specified in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file:
  - discovery.seed_hosts
  - discovery.seed_providers
  - cluster.initial_master_nodes
  - discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts
  - discovery.zen.hosts_provider
